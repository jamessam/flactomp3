This is a python3 script to convert a directory of FLAC or WAV files to MP3. It can be extended to accept any audio format, should you choose to extend it.

This script does not require any module beyond the standard library, though it does assume FFMPEG and bwfmetadit (CLI version) are installed on the machine and added to the path.
