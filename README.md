This is a python3 script to convert a directory of FLAC or WAV files to MP3. It can be extended to accept any audio format, should you choose to extend it.

This script does not require any module beyond the standard library, though it does require FFMPEG and bwfmetadit (CLI version) to be installed on Macs. It assumes those programs are installed and added to the path on other OS's.
